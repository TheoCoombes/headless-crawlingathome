# headless-crawlingathome

This script runs crawlingathome from linux box. Still having troubles with cairo, maybe will replace with another SVG processing library.

##How to use

1. create an empty environment with python 3.8
2. run ```git clone https://github.com/rvencu/headless-crawlingathome```
3. run ```python ./headless-crawlingathome/setup.py```
4. edit ```./headless-crawlingathome/cah.py``` to edit your nickname on line 2
5. run ```python ./headless-crawlingathome/test.py``` to contribute

todo: test.py script still needs optimization
